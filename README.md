# Simple-HTML-website-Triggering-cloud-function
Here I have written a .html file and included javascript code as well. At the End, It will trigger a cloud Function. 


index.html file contains the html and JS code where we simply get a mail id from a user and then once submitted. That triggers a cloud function written in python and validates if that 
email is valid or not depending on if it contains @ and '.' 

After doing the unit testing locally, I deployed it on App-Engine for testing.
